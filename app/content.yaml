     <p>What makes open data a powerful tool for governing better is that the ability of people inside and 
     outside of institutions to use the same data to create useful policies, tools, visualizations, maps, and apps. 
     Open data can provide the raw material to convene informed conversations about what’s broken and the 
     empirical foundation for developing solutions.</p>
