  <p><b>Network of Innovators (NoI)</b> is an application designed and
  developed by The GovLab in collaboration with governance innovation leaders
  across seven countries. The tool makes searchable the know-how of government
  innovators on topics integral to governing more effectively and legitimately,
  such as citizen engagement, opening data and prize-backed challenges. By
  answering questions about governance innovation skills and experiences, the
  participant creates a profile, enabling her to be matched to those with
  complementary knowledge—either those who are similar or different—to enable
  mutual support and learning.</p>
  <p><b>NoI</b> adopts a more nuanced way of sharing and finding expertise – one that
  looks beyond traditional credentials to focus on real world know how. Instead
  of rigid categories or open-ended tags, NoI attempts to get at what people know
  by asking the kinds of questions they could answer. In response to those
  questions, they can specify the expertise they have and want to share: whether
  they have the ability to do something, to tell someone about it, or to refer
  them to others knowledgeable about the topic.</p>
  <p><b>NoI</b> is an experiment intended to help the community learn if expert
  networking is an effective means to:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Find who else has experience trying an innovation.
  <li>Identify who has worked on a particular type of policy or problem.
  <li>Find collaborators to develop new ideas for tackling a shared problem together.
  <li>Form alliances and networks of supporters.
  <li>Create a visual map of your own and other people’s expertise and the ability to compare skills across countries.
  <li>Describe the job profile of the 21st century public servant.
  </ul>
  <p>We want to hear from you.</p>

  <h3>NHS - GovLab Collaboration</h3>
  <p>Innovation is critical to enabling NHS England to achieve its ambitions to
  ramp up the pace and scale of change, and deliver better outcomes for
  patients. With the Five Year Forward Plan NHS England has clearly articulated
  the fundamental role of data and innovation in achieving these ambitions at
  all levels of the organization.</p>
  <p>The NHS Health and Care Innovation Expo presents a unique opportunity to
  map and tap into the collective mindset of a broad cross-section of those who
  work in and around the NHS in real time about the demand for collecting,
  sharing and using data to improve outcomes.</p>
  <p>From September 2-3, you are invited to participate in Network of
  Innovators, an experiment of The GovLab.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How can we make innovation actionable?
    <li>How can we make manifest the expertise and capacity for innovation that already exists within and across NHS England?
    <li>How can we connect innovators across domains and disciplines
  </ul>
  <h3>The GovLab Experiment</h3>
  <p>Network of Innovators (NoI) is a collaborative platform to connect and
  search for people across organizations, institutions, sectors and
  communities. By answering questionnaires across a range of topics related to
  your innovation skills and experiences, NoI will match you to others with
  complementary knowledge to enable learning and support.</p>
  <p>Network of Innovators (NoI) Experiment has been developed by The GovLab in
  partnership with governance innovation leaders across seven countries.  This
  is an experiment. We want to understand whether the approach works, how
  people use such a tool, and how they might want to use it in the future. The
  aim is both to enhance the conference experience by matching people for
  mutual benefit but also to improve the design of the platform. Questionnaires
  Answer questions to understand your own expertise, find allies and
  collaborators & learn from others.</p>
