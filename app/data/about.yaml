  <p><b>Network of Innovators (NoI)</b> is an application designed and
  developed by The GovLab in collaboration with governance innovation leaders
  across seven countries. The tool makes searchable the know-how of government
  innovators on topics integral to governing more effectively and legitimately,
  such as citizen engagement, opening data and prize-backed challenges. By
  answering questions about governance innovation skills and experiences, the
  participant creates a profile, enabling her to be matched to those with
  complementary knowledge—either those who are similar or different—to enable
  mutual support and learning.</p>
  <p><b>NoI</b> adopts a more nuanced way of sharing and finding expertise – one that
  looks beyond traditional credentials to focus on real world know how. Instead
  of rigid categories or open-ended tags, NoI attempts to get at what people know
  by asking the kinds of questions they could answer. In response to those
  questions, they can specify the expertise they have and want to share: whether
  they have the ability to do something, to tell someone about it, or to refer
  them to others knowledgeable about the topic.</p>
  <p><b>NoI</b> is an experiment intended to help the community learn if expert
  networking is an effective means to:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Find who else has experience trying an innovation.
  <li>Identify who has worked on a particular type of policy or problem.
  <li>Find collaborators to develop new ideas for tackling a shared problem together.
  <li>Form alliances and networks of supporters.
  <li>Create a visual map of your own and other people’s expertise and the ability to compare skills across countries.
  <li>Describe the job profile of the 21st century public servant.
  </ul>
  <p>We want to hear from you.</p>
