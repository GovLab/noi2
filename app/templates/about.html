  <h1>About the Network of Innovators</h1>
</div>


<div class="col-md-12">
<p><b>Network of Innovators (NoI) Experiment</b> is a collaborative platform designed and developed by The GovLab in partnership with governance innovation leaders across seven countries. NoI aims to connect and search for people across organizations, institutions, and communities. By answering questions about your open data and other governance innovation skills and experiences, the app will match you to those coming to Ottawa with complementary knowledge to enable learning and support.</p>

<p>This is an <b>experiment</b>. We want to understand whether the approach works, how people use such a tool, and how they might want to use it in the future. The aim is both to enhance the conference experience by matching people for mutual benefit but also to improve the design of the platform. Questionnaires on open data and prizes are currently available. Crowdsourcing, citizen science, public-private partnerships and more skills surveys to come. Answer questions to understand your own expertise! Find allies and collaborators! Learn from others!</p>

<p><p>Why the NoI?</b> There is possibly no more important public issue today than how to evolve our governing organizations to make them better able to recognize and implement innovative and effective ways of solving 21st century problems. Administration that is supposed to solve critical problems on its own — an outgrowth of the professionalization of public life in the industrial age — is inadequate for a complex, networked world. Governments and institutions need to learn to make use of the full gamut of expertise — formal scientific knowledge and credentials, but also skills, experiences and craft know-how — to tackle the challenges society will face in the coming years. The next step in the process of improving the ways we solve public problems is to create the “conversational infrastructure” for matching human capital to opportunities where know-how can be applied to tackle hard problems.</p>
