            <p class="e-question">What is Network of Innovators?</p>
            <p class="e-answer">Network of Innovators (NoI) is an expert network designed and developed by The GovLab in collaboration with governance innovation leaders across eight countries. It makes searchable the know-how of government innovators on topics integral to governing more effectively and legitimately, such as open data, citizen engagement and prize-backed challenges. By answering questions about your governance innovation skills and experiences, you can be matched to those with complementary knowledge to enable mutual support and learning.</p>

            <p class="e-question">What problem does NoI aim to solve?</p>
            <p class="e-answer">In large institutions, there is no good way to target opportunities for collaboration. Professionals working in a variety of contexts - from regulatory agencies to social innovation labs - have a hard time identifying who among their colleagues and peers has the experience and expertise to better solve problems. There are a number of factors feeding into this reality:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Titles and credentials donâ€™t capture real world know-how.</li>
              <li>Government projects or public-private partnerships are typically branded as institutional achievements.</li>
              <li>There is a lack of well developed taxonomies of  skills for new domain areas of government, like open data or prize-backed challenges. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="e-faq-item">
            <p class="e-question">What is the goal of NoI?</p>
            <p class="e-answer">NoI aims to organize and develop the taxonomy of innovation practices. Through ongoing engagement with governance innovation practitioners from around the world, we are continuing to refine NoI with a focus on capturing the most impactful and desirable innovation skills for public servants today.</p>
