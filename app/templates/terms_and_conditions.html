<div class="e-content">
1. Introduction
Network of Innovators (“NoI”) is an online platform for building expert networks. The Governance Lab (“GovLab” or “we”) provides the NoI service in order to connect users with each other to share knowledge and expertise and to promote collaboration.

1.1. Agreement
By registering to use NoI, you are entering into a legal agreement and you agree to all the terms and conditions set forth in this Terms of Service.

By clicking “Get Started”, “Join Now”, “Join”, or similar buttons used for registering, accessing or otherwise using Network of Innovators, either in your individual capacity or on behalf of a company, you are entering into a legally binding agreement that includes this Terms of Service, as may be amended by the GovLab from time to time. If you do not agree to this Agreement, do NOT click "Get Started" (or similar) and do not access or otherwise use any of our services. 

2. Obligations

2.1. Service Eligibility

To use Network of Innovators, you agree that you will (1) only have one NoI account; (2) your NoI account must be in your real name; and (3) you have not been restricted by GovLab from using NoI.

2.2. Registration Requirements

You agree choose a strong and secure password and you will keep your password a secret. You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse. 

2.3. Notices

You agree that GovLab may use our websites, apps, and email to provide you with important notices about NoI. These notices can be made in the following ways: (1) a banner notice on NoI, or (2) an email sent to an address you provided during registration. You agree to keep your contact information up to date.

2.4. Messages and Sharing

You understand that, when sharing information on NoI, others can see, copy, and use the information you have shared. The NoI service allows messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such as through your public profile and the activity page. Where we have made or when we make settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see your content or information. We are not obligated to publish any information or content on NoI and can remove it in our sole discretion, with or without notice.

3. Rights and Limits

3.1 Your License to GovLab

All content, feedback, and personal information you provide on NoI is owned by you, but you grant GovLab a non-exclusive license to use it. You agree that you will only provide information and content that you have the right to share, and that your NoI profile will contain accurate and truthful information. 

While you own all content and information that you submit or post to NoI, you grant GovLab the following non-exclusive license:

A worldwide, transferable, and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publish, and process, information and content that you provide through NoI, without any further consent, notice, and/or compensation to you or others. 

3.2. License Limitations

You agree to only provide content or information that does not violate the law nor anyone's rights (e.g., without violating any intellectual property rights or breaching a contract). 

You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from NoI, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you shared it with others in NoI and they copied or stored it and (b) for the reasonable time it takes for GovLab to remove the content from backup and other systems. 

If GovLab wants to give others the right to publish your posts beyond NoI, we will get your express consent. However, other users of NoI may access and share your content and information, consistent with your settings and acceptance of this Terms of Service. 

GovLab may edit and make formatting changes to your content (such as translating it, modifying the size, layout or file type or removing metadata), but we will not modify the meaning of your expression.  Because you own your content and information and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, for example under the terms of a Creative Commons license.  GovLab may be required by law to remove certain information or content in certain countries.

By submitting suggestions or other feedback to GovLab regarding NoI, you agree that GovLab can use and share such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you. 

3.3. Service Availability

GovLab may change or discontinue Network of Innovators at any time and does not promise to store or maintain access to any information or content you've posted.

GovLab may change, suspend, or end any functionality of NoI. To the extent allowed under law, these changes may be effective upon notice provided to you.

NoI is a platform for connecting with others to share knowledge and expertise. It is not a storage platform. You agree that GovLab has no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law.

3.3. Other Content, Sites and apps

When you see or use content and information posted by others on NoI, you do so at your own risk. Third parties may offer their own products and services through NoI and GovLab does not accept responsibility for those third-party activities.

By using NoI, you may encounter content or information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive or otherwise harmful. GovLab generally does not maintain responsibility for reviewing all content provided by users of NoI. You agree that GovLab is not responsible for third parties' (including other users') content or information or for any damages as a result of your use of or reliance on it.

You are responsible for deciding if you want to access or use third party apps or sites that you encounter in using NoI. If you allow a third party app or site to authenticate you or connect with your NoI account, that app or site may be able to access information on NoI related to you and your connections. Third party apps and sites have their own legal terms and privacy policies, and you may be giving others permission to use your information in ways GovLab would not. Therefore, except to the limited extent it may be required by applicable law, GovLab is not responsible for these other sites and apps. You use such third-party services at your own risk.

3.4. Limits

GovLab reserves the right to limit how users connect and interact on Network of Innovators. 

GovLab reserves the right to limit your use of NoI, including the number of your connections and your ability to contact other users. GovLab reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your account if GovLab believes that you may be in breach of these Terms of Service or law or are otherwise misusing the Services.

GovLab reserves all of its intellectual property rights in NoI. For example, "Network of Innovators", "NoI", and other GovLab trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with GovLab and Network of Innovators are trademarks or registered trademarks of GovLab. Other trademarks and logos used in connection with Network of Innovators may be the trademarks of their respective owners.

4. Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to NoI. We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, and if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice as described above in Section 2.3., or by other means so that you may review the changes before you continue to use NoI. If you object to any changes, you may delete your NoI account. By continuing to use NoI after we publish or communicate a notice about any changes to this Privacy Policy you are consenting to the changes.

4.1. Information Collected and Used

The Privacy Policy applies to any member of NoI. When you use NoI, we collect information necessary to providing a useful, relevant, and personalized experience. Personal information provided to or collected by NoI is controlled by GovLab. If you have any concern about providing information to us or having such information displayed on NoI or otherwise used in any manner consistent with the Privacy Policy or Terms of Service, you should not register to be a member of NoI. If you have already registered, you can close your account at any time by contacting us at noi@thegovlab.org. No information will remain in the NoI database should you chose to delete your account.

The information you share on NoI will be used solely for the purpose of maintaining and operating NoI, including anonymous NoI usage analysis. Your data will not be shared with any third parties. 

4.1.1. We collect your personal information in the following ways:

Registration

When you create an account with us, we collect information (including your name, email address, and password).

In order to register for NoI, you must provide us with at least your name, email address, and a password and agree to our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy, which governs how we treat your information. You may provide additional information during the registration flow to help you build your profile and personalize your experience, such as by answering our matching questions. You understand that, by creating an account, we and others will be able to identify you by your NoI profile.

Profile Information

We collect information when you fill out your profile. After you create an account, you may choose to provide additional information on your NoI profile. 

Customer Service

We collect information when you contact us for user support or provide feedback via the Share Feedback function. We do not use this information for any reason other than to improve NoI.

New Functions

The GovLab is constantly seeking new ways of improving NoI, which may result in new ways to collect information from members. When new features are introduced, they may require the collection of new information. Notice of these new ways of collecting information will always be provided to you via one of the methods outlined in the Terms of Service. 

4.1.2. We Use Your Information in the Following Ways:

Third Parties

We do not share your personal information with any third party advertisers or ad networks. We do not use your personal information for even other GovLab services. However, as noted, your profile is visible to other members of NoI. Supplying to us any information deemed “sensitive” by applicable law is entirely voluntary on your part. 

We will never rent, sell, or otherwise share your information with any third party. In the event that GovLab discontinues NoI, all information provided by users and controlled by GovLab will be deleted. 

You can withdraw or modify your consent to our collection and processing of the information you provide at any time by deleting your NoI account.

Communications

As described above, we may send you notices relating to NoI, including through email and notices posted on the NoI and GovLab websites or apps. 

User Communications

NoI allows you to communicate with others using the service via email, and recipients can see your name and email address. 

Personalizing the NoI Experience

We use the information and content you provide on NoI to improve the relevance and usefulness of NoI, including personalizing your experience through our matching function. We try to match you with other users that are relevant to you. We do not rent or sell personal information that you have not posted on NoI. We will not disclose personal information that is not published to your profile.

Search

You can search for other members of NoI based on certain parameters. The information provided via creating a profile and answering our matching questions is used to inform and refine our search capabilities.

Compliance with Legal Process and Other Disclosures

We may need to disclose personal information, profile information, or information about your activities as a member when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce the Terms of Service, investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, or protect the security or integrity of NoI; or (3) exercise or protect the rights, property, or safety of NoI, our members, personnel, or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal information when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. In light of our principles, we may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but do not commit to challenge every demand. 

4.2. Rights

You can change your NoI information at any time by editing your profile, deleting content that you have posted, or by closing your account. 

You have a right to (1) access, modify, correct, or delete your personal information controlled by GovLab regarding your profile, (2) change or remove your content, and (3) close your account. If you close your account, under normal circumstances, your information will be deleted within 24 hours. 

You should note, however that any Information you have shared with others or that others have copied may also remain visible after you have deleted your account or deleted the information from your account. You may not be able to access, correct, or eliminate any information about you that other members copied or exported out of NoI prior to your deletion, because this information may not be in our control. 

4.3. Data Retention

We keep your information for as long as your account is active or as needed. We may keep certain information even after you close your account if it is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce this agreement.

4.4. Changes to the Privacy Policy

GovLab may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes in the way we treat your personal information, or to the Privacy Policy, we will provide notice to you. Please review the changes carefully. By continuing to use NoI after changes have been published and you have been notified, you agree to the changes. If you object to any of the changes to our terms and you no longer wish to use NoI, you may delete your account.
