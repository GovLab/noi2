"<h3>NHS - GovLab Collaboration</h3> <p>Innovation is critical to enabling"
" NHS England to achieve its ambitions to ramp up the pace and scale of "
"change, and deliver better outcomes for patients. With the Five Year "
"Forward Plan NHS England has clearly articulated the fundamental role of "
"data and innovation in achieving these ambitions at all levels of the "
"organization.</p> <p>The NHS Health and Care Innovation Expo presents a "
"unique opportunity to map and tap into the collective mindset of a broad "
"cross-section of those who work in and around the NHS in real time about "
"the demand for collecting, sharing and using data to improve "
"outcomes.</p> <p>From September 2-3, you are invited to participate in "
"Network of Innovators, an experiment of The GovLab.</p> <ul>\n"
"  <li>How can we make innovation actionable?\n"
"  <li>How can we make manifest the expertise and capacity for innovation "
"that already exists within and across NHS England?\n"

"</ul> <h3>The GovLab Experiment</h3> <p>Network of Innovators (NoI) is a "
"collaborative platform to connect and search for people across "
"organizations, institutions, sectors and communities. By answering "
"questionnaires across a range of topics related to your innovation skills"
" and experiences, NoI will match you to others with complementary "
"knowledge to enable learning and support.</p> <p>Network of Innovators "
"(NoI) Experiment has been developed by The GovLab in partnership with "
"governance innovation leaders across seven countries.  This is an "
"experiment. We want to understand whether the approach works, how people "
"use such a tool, and how they might want to use it in the future. The aim"
" is both to enhance the conference experience by matching people for "
"mutual benefit but also to improve the design of the platform. "
